// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Quick Start provides two deployment options, using the same template, depending on whether the GitToS3integration parameter is set to *true* or *false*:

* https://fwd.aws/QAmBk?[Deploy with Git to S3 integration] This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the pipeline created by AWS CodePipeline, along with other infrastructure components. It also builds an API Gateway interface and Lambda functions that allow an automatic trigger to the pipeline via webhooks, when the code is committed to the Git repository. The Git to S3 integration automatically uploads the code into the S3 bucket location referenced by the source stage of the pipeline, which automatically triggers code deployment on the pipeline.

* https://fwd.aws/QAmBk?[Deploy without Git to S3 integration] This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the pipeline created by CodePipeline, along with other infrastructure components. The pipeline gets automatically triggered when the zip file package is uploaded to the S3 bucket location that is referenced in the source stage.
